One way to control elevation is done by changing offset value in Earth.cfg, but it is depended by EarthHeight.dds texture
```
VertexHeightMap
	{
	offset = -1000.0 //-2000.0
	deformity = 17300.0 //15600.0 //7000 // 5000
	map = RSS-Textures/PluginData/EarthHeight.dds
	}
```
For create EarthHeight.dds it was use http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/mgg/image/2minrelief.html + http://visibleearth.nasa.gov/view.php?id=73934 & diferite special layer to control brightness, tone, colour variation ...

There are two versions of EarthHeight.dds, the difference is given by the lightness and an extra layer for have 2 situation for more testing option
